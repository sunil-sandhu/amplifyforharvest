            <h3 class="serosensa-red">Serosensa's real-time admin goody-box for all clients</h3>

            <div class="text-box">

                <p>Predominantly designed for retained clients, Amplify is our new online client dashboard system designed to dramatically update the way we report how and where your money is being spent. It's secure, engaging, convenient and useful.</p>
                <p class="keep-on-one-column">Amplify will bring unprecedented depth and transparency to a client-agency relationship, reporting your key information in real-time at a glance. If you want more detail, Amplify will fill your screen with progression for every live project you have. If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty, V2 of Amplify's reporting will extend right down to a full description of what was done every time we've ever worked for you - EVER!<br><br>Yes. Every minute ever.</p>


                <p>You can access Amplify on your phone just as easily as you can on any desktop computer and we'll keep it beautiful and uncluttered on any screen you can throw at it.</p>
                <p>Amplify is available for retained clients as of today. Get in touch and we'll setup your username and password so you can take the system for a ride.</p>
                <p>Of course, for clients not on our retainer, Amplify is very useful for monitoring the progress of larger pre-budgeted jobs such as video production, websites, ad campaigns, brochures etc. So let us know if you'd like to implement Amplify on your next big project. Oh and if you're thinking, "What the hell is a retainer?"</p>
